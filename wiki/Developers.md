### Introduction

Project Arsenal aims to implement unique features alongside its regular content.
In order to allow other addon creators to use these features as well, an API has been created.

The API itself is **included** in Project Arsenal's main jar, in order to remove the need for users to download the API separately.
However, it is recommended that developers **only target the API jar**, as Project Arsenal's main jar is subject to changes between versions.

This guide aims to explain how this API works, and how to implement it.
