### 🚀 Version support
**Project Arsenal** aims to always be compatible with the latest version(s) of the game.
However, the mod can only be released for versions supported by MrCrayfish's Gun Mod.

| Active development     | Bugfixes only | Discontinued         |
|------------------------|---------------|----------------------|
| 1.19.4, 1.19.2, 1.18.2 | 1.16.5        | 1.19.3, 1.19.1, 1.19 |

* **Active development:** These versions are actively being worked on and will receive new content and features as well as bug fixes
* **Bugfixes only:** These versions will no longer receive new content and/or features, but will continue to receive bug fixes
* **Discontinued:** These versions will no longer receive any updates

> Backports to older versions such as 1.15.2 and 1.12.2 are not being considered, as this would require not only a full rewrite of the entire mod, but these versions also lack key features this mod depends on.
